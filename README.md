## The Problem
In my childhood days, I wondered about the mirror talking in the fairy tales and obey the command of their masters. That made me think…

We too use mirror everyday, but when we use it we would also use our mobile to check the YouTube for makeup tutorials and much more or check news on the phone and the most important when you are busy getting ready but you need to turn on a light or turn on a Wi-Fi enabled oven or kettle. One day I was wondering if I could get both combined into one. Yes, That was the idea behind this project “THE SMART MIRROR”. 

## The Solution
➤ The Solution for the above mentioned problem is to build a smart mirror. The mirror can stream videos from YouTube and also show navigation from maps and the best part is you can use Google Assistant and control the IOT devices. I will also show how to mirror works with a IOT LED Light. You can also screen cast your android device. 

➤ And the mirror also has personalized dashboards for different users. It identifies the person based on Face Recognition using OPENCV and custom Dashboards for each user.

## The Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* OpenCV
* Raspberry pi
* IOT 
* Magic Mirror
* Voice Assistants
* Machine Learning
* Artificial Intelligence
* Magic Mirror
* A bit of robotics
* And Finally Linux

## Future Scope

As now most of the houses are automated and this mirror will be a Admin console and also in the future we can add an IR frame and detect touches and this project provides the perfect solution for our day to day life problem while getting ready and luckily it also has personalized dashboards for each user or profiles. Most of us already have Alexa or Google Assistant in our houses but this combines the work of A Mirror , A Admin Console, A Voice assistant and also  A Streaming device. Can you say someone who doesn’t want to automate his house to be like Tony Stark’s AKA The Iron Man at a low cost.
